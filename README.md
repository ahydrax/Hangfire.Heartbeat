Hangfire.Heartbeat is a simple server monitoring plugin for Hangfire.  It can easily be used to monitor CPU and RAM usage of the process that is running hangfire jobs, and optionally can monitor additional processes as well.

Read about hangfire here: https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire#hangfire-
and here: http://hangfire.io/

## Instructions
Install a package from Nuget.

Then add this in your code:

for service side:
```csharp
app.UseHangfireServer(additionalProcesses: new[] { new ProcessMonitor(checkInterval: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1)) });
```

for dashboard:
```csharp
services.AddHangfire(configuration => configuration.UseHeartbeatPage(checkInterval: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1)));
```
It's not recommended to specify `checkInterval` less than 1 second as it can cause additional load on db server. Also I recommend to use the same interval as for server and dashboard.
